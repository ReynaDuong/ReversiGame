# ReversiGame

The project is the implementation of the board game Othello. 
The game played by two players, Black and White. 
It is played on an N by N board. 
The winner is the player who has morediscs of his color than hisopponent at the end of the game. 
This will happen whenneither of the two players has a legal move or there are no spaces left on the board.
At the beginning of the game, two black discs and two white discs are placed in the middle of the board.Black always begins, and the two players subsequently take turns moving.At his turn, a player must place a disc of his color on one of the empty squares of the board, adjacent to an opponent's disc. No two matching colors are connected vertically or horizontally.A legal move is one that consists of, for example, a black piece being placed on theboard that creates a straight line made up of a black piece at either end and only whitepieces in between. When a player achieves this, they must complete the move byturning any white pieces in between the two black so that they line becomes entirelyblack. This turning action must be completed for every legal turning line that iscreated with the placing of the new piece.Players will then continue to move alternately until they get to the end of the gameand a winner is decided.The winner is the one with the most points.
